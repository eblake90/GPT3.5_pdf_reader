To  determine  whether \n\ngerminating almond seeds contain cellulase. To determine if lignin limits cellulase from breaking \n\ndown cellulose and if lignin weakens this property under heat. \n\nIntroduction: \n\nIn  any  alcohol  beverage  industry,  the  requirement  of  monosaccharide  is  a  must  to  allow  for \n\nmicrobial  fermenters,  such  as,  yeast  to  easily  breakdown  the  simple  sugars  into  alcohol  in  an \n\nanaerobic environment. Within this practical, the studying of the process used in creating these \n\nsimple sugars from barley shall take place. This process requires the usage of amylase enzyme that \n\nis produced by germinating barley seeds. Germinating barley seeds synthesize amylases during \n\ngermination due to the fact that their endosperm (food storage) is composed of starch which needs \n\nto be broken down, Bilderback. (1971). As such, pre-soaking the seeds with water will allow the \n\ngermination process to commence where one can then take full advantage and extract the amylase \n\nneeded for the production of simple sugars. The presence of this amylase enzyme shall be proven \n\nby aqueous extraction of the amylase from germinated barley seeds via crushing and centrifugation. \n\nThis aqueous extract will then be tested by adding it into varying corn starch concentrations with \n\nvarying enzymatic extract quantities. This will allow for qualitatively determining the presence of \n\nglucose/maltodextrin and the absence of starch, which will both allow for the confirmation that \n\nthe aqueous extract contains amylase. The absence of starch will be tested via the iodine test which \n\nwill have a blue/purple colour if starch is present or will have a brown/yellow colour if no starch \n\nis present. Therefore, a hypothesis shall be stated that if the absence of starch is determined from \n\na known quantity of corn starch, then there is amylase present in germinating barley seeds. \n\nThe creation of large quantities of ethanol requires staggering amounts of glucose. As such, within \n\nthis day and age, the breakdown of the large glucose chains called cellulose takes place. Within \n\nthe  second  experiment,  the  detection  of  cellulase  found  in  almond  seeds  shall  take  place.  The \n\ncellulase  found  in  the  almond  seeds  react  on  the  glycosidic  bonds  found  in  cellulose,  thereby \n\nbreaking down the cellulose into simple sugars. As such, within this practical, one shall first detect \n\nthe  presence  of  cellulase  in  almond  seeds  via  the  presence  of  maltodextrin  and  glucose  via \n\nFehling\u2019s test, which turns reddish brown in the presence of simple sugars. Hence the hypothesis \n\nthat if glucose is detected after adding the almond seed aqueous extract to the cellulose source, \n\n \n\fPRACTICAL 1: STARCH-DIGESTING ENZYMES FROM BARLEY AND CELLULOSE-\nDIGESTING ENZYMES FROM ALMONDS \n\n3 \n\nthen cellulase is present in almond seeds. The major problem with the breakdown of cellulose into \n\nsimple  sugars  is  the  presence  of  lignin  which  is  a  strong  polymer  which  links  cellulose  chains \n\ntogether and is resistant to cellulase, therefore it will limit cellulase\u2019s breakdown of cellulose into \n\nglucose. As such, when exposing three sources of cellulose with different concentrations of lignin \n\none will notice that the lower lignin concentrated source will produce more glucose molecules. \n\nHence hypothesis, if lower concentrated lignin sources possess more glucose than higher lignin \n\nconcentrated cellulose after addition to cellulase enzymes, then lignin limits cellulose break down. \n\nFurthermore,  a  paper  by  Reddy  et  al.  (2017)  had  shown  that  lignin  loses strength  significantly \n\nwhen heated. As such, a hypothesis shall be stated that if there is a higher presence of glucose \n\nwhen  cellulase  is  added  to  boiled  wood,  paper  and  cotton  samples  than  that  of  identical  room \n\ntemperature cellulose/lignin sources then lignin  reduces efficiency in  preventing cellulase from \n\nbreaking down cellulose. \n\nProcedure: \n\nFor protocol refer to source below, by Buhagiar.

\n\nModifications to protocol: \n\nExperiment 1: \n\n\u2022  One  shall  pre-soak 20 \ud835\udc54  of  barley  seeds  with 10 \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc59  of \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3b2\ud835\udc42  (not 20 \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc59  of \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3b2\ud835\udc42 )  and \n\ncrush it into a smooth paste.  \n\n\u2022  One must repeat the test following addition of the barley\u2019s supernatant with corn starch \n\nevery 15 \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b not every 3 \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b. \n\n\u2022  The reaction of the barley\u2019s supernatant with corn starch will only be performed at room \n\ntemperature. \n\nTable 1 have been modified as the following: \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\fPRACTICAL 1: STARCH-DIGESTING ENZYMES FROM BARLEY AND CELLULOSE-\nDIGESTING ENZYMES

uneven crushing, hence some groups\u2019 \n\nextract may be more concentrated than others. \n\n\u2022  The surface area of the wood samples differed greatly from test to test, hence it is possible \n\nthat  more  finely  shaven  wood  chips  will  have  a  disproportionately  higher  glucose \n\nconcentration than other wood samples. \n\n\u2022  Different seeds contain different concentrations of amylase or cellulase, thus, there will be \n\na disproportionate concentration of amylase and cellulase between groups. \n\nPrecautions: \n\n\u2022  When mixing the corn starch in the deionized water, one must make sure no starch blobs \n\nare present so as to allow for full enzymatic reaction. \n\n\u2022  The  barley  must  be  crushed  into  a  smooth  pasted  so  as  to  extract  as  much  amylase  as \n\npossible. \n\n\u2022  Care was taken when handling phloroglucinol and only used within the fume hood as it \n\ncan cause mild nausea on exposure, hence Shin et al., (2020). \n\n \n \n

can be seen that as the concentration of the original batch strength of the \n\nbarleys aqueous  extract  increases the time at  which  all corn starch is  hydrolyzed  decreases. As \n\nsuch, this will support the hypothesis that amylase is present in the aqueous extract, hence is also \n\npresent in the barley seeds. As stated by Silano et al. (2017), the amylase found within germinating \n\nbarley  seeds  is  beta-amylase  which  will  hydrolyze  the  glycosidic  bonds  of  the  starch  thereby \n\nreducing  this  polysaccharide  into  maltose  and/or  glucose.  The  maltose  can  also  be  subject  to \n\nfurther hydrolysis by amylase into glucose. \n\nIt  was  found  by  Novaes  et  al.  (2010),  that  wood  contains  approximately  25%  lignin  and  70% \n\ncellulose. While Chang et al. (2021) found that wood contains approximately 10% lignin. Due to \n\nthe limited information about the wood used within this practical, an assumption was made that \n\nthe  wood  contained  approximately  17.5%  lignin.  Ma\u0142achowska  et  al.  (2021)  found  that  paper \n\ncontains 3%  to  14% lignin,  hence within this practical  the  assumption that the paper used was \n\napproximately 8.5% lignin was taken. It was found by Chang et al. (2021) that cotton contains less \n\nthan  1%  lignin. While  Kang  et  al.  (2012)  found  a  percentage  range  of  0.43%  to  1.29%  lignin \n\nconcentration. Hence an assumption was made that the cotton used within this practical contained \n\n0.86% lignin. As such, as seen in Table 3, it was found that only cotton contained simple sugars \n\nwhile  the  other  higher  lignin  containing  substrates  did  not.  As  such,  this  supports  the  two \n\nhypothesis that the almond seed aqueous extract contains cellulase and that lignin limits cellulase \n\nbreaking down cellulose into simple sugars. Furthermore, support for the hypothesis that lignin \n\nweakens due to heat thereby increasing the cellulase\u2019s rate of cellulose breakdown was not found. \n\nSince  within  Table  3,  there  was  no  differences  between  the  temperature  and 40 \u2103  test.  But  a \n\nreview by Brebu & Vasile. (2010) shows that lignin does in fact weaken due to heat hence will \n\nsupport the hypothesis that cellulase will be more effective on the substrates, but further tests are \n\nneeded to prove this. \n\nTo conclude, germinating barley seeds contain amylase which can be explored within alcoholic \n\nbeverage factory by making the cost of breaking down polysaccharides into simple sugars cheaper. \n\nThe  presence  of  cellulase  was  also  found  within  almond  seeds.  The  cellulase  is  an  excellent \n\nenzyme that is able to covert useless cellulose into large quantities of useful glucose, which can be \n\nused  for  ethanol  production  (for  example,  the  70%  ethanol  used  to  sterilize  laboratories). \n\n\fPRACTICAL 1: STARCH-DIGESTING ENZYMES FROM BARLEY AND CELLULOSE-\nDIGESTING ENZYMES FROM ALMONDS \n\n8 \n\nFurthermore, lignin is a complex polymer that will limit the breakdown of cellulose by cellulase, \n\nas such, it can be weakened using heat for more efficient cellulose breakdown. \n\nReferences: \n\nBilderback, D.

The \n\ntransformation of bacteria is extremely important in the molecular cloning industry as it allows \n\none to synthesize huge quantities of a targeted recombinant DNA molecule. This transformation is \n\nmainly performed using plasmids, which contain the targeted recombinant DNA. But the plasmids \n\nmust first enter these bacteria cells which is performed via artificial means within this practical. \n\nThe plasmid will then incorporate within the bacteria\u2019s DNA which will thereby be copied and \n\nreplicated within successive generations. This thereby creates a near limitless  production of the \n\ntargeted recombinant DNA molecule. Furthermore, the need for preparing competent E. coli cells \n\nis a must. A competent bacterial cell is defined as a bacterial cell that is able to take up foreign \n\nDNA  from  the  surrounding  environment  (Tang  et  al.,  1994).  Within  this  practical  the \n\ntransformation of E. coli cells into ampicillin (an antibiotic) resistance cells shall take place using \n\nplasmid conferring antibiotic resistance. Hence hypothesis, if there exist bacterial colonies within \n\nthe agar plate containing ampicillin, then  the transformation  of E. coli  to  resist  antibiotics was \n\nsuccessfully  performed.  Furthermore,  one  will  then  be  able  to  use  the  agar  plates  of  different \n\ndilution factors of the bacteria to determine the efficiency of this transformation. \n\n \n \n \n\fPRACTICAL 2: TRANSFORMATION OF BACTERIAL CELLS \n\n3 \n\nProcedure: \n\nPlease find protocol by, Cassar.

Next  the  incorporation  of \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc4e2+  was  performed \n\nusing  a  10\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc59  of  100\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc40   \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc592 .  The  \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc4e2+  cations  were  gently  incorporated  onto  the  cell \n\nmembrane of the E. coli by using low temperatures. The purpose of the \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc4e2+ and \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc542+ cations \n\nare to neutralize the negatively charged components on the cell membrane, thus, preventing the \n\n  \n \n \n\fPRACTICAL 2: TRANSFORMATION OF BACTERIAL CELLS \n\n6 \n\nnegatively charged plasmid from electrostatically repelling from the E. coli, (Chehal et al., 2007). \n\nAfter this, the E. coli cells were then considered as competent cells. Next, one will extract a small \n\nvolume of these competent E. coli cells and mix it with a small volume of plasmids. At first, the \n\ncompetent cells will not be able to take up the plasmids, but once the \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc592 and \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc592 treated \n\ncells are heat shocked using 45 \u2103 for 45 \ud835\udc60, the cell membrane will become strongly depolarized. \n\nThis results in a decrease in the membrane potential which in turn reduces the negativity within \n\nthe cell. As such, thanks  to  the \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc4e2+ and \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc542+ neutralizing  the  negatively  charged membrane, \n\nthe negatively charged plasmid will be bind to the lipopolysaccharide of the cell membrane which \n\nwill then create a pore, thus allowing it to enter the cell after the heat shock period, (Nakata et al., \n\n1997; Chang et al., 2017). To increase the efficiency of the transformation one will incorporate \n\nmagnesium within the cell, (Asif et al., 2017). This is due to the fact that once the plasmid is within \n\nthe E. coli cell, the cell will need to break a DNA linkage from the plasmid and at the gene of \n\ninterest.  Thus,  incorporated \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc542+  will  act  as  a  co-factor  to  increase  DNase  activity,  thereby \n\nincreasing  the probability of successfully incorporating the plasmid into the DNA (Magnesium \n\nChloride Solution 1 M., 2022). \n\nWithin this practical the assumption that the formation of one colony is due to only one E. coli cell \n\nwas taken. This was done so that one can estimate the concentration of the bacteria in a specific \n\namount  of  solution.  Furthermore,  this  practical  found  that  out  of  a  batch  concentration  of \n\n18,300,000\n\n\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc48\n\n\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc59\n\n ,  zero  successful  E.  coli  transformations  were  performed,  hence  a  0 % \n\ntransformation  efficiency. As  such,  it  can  be  stated  that  the  experiment  was  a  failure  hence  no \n\nsuccessful  E.  coli  transformations.  The  failure  within  this  practical  could  possibly  be  due  to  a \n\nnumber  of  factors.  Such  as,  sub-optimal  plasmid  quality  (i.e.  the  plasmid  is  expired)  or  the \n\nconcentration of the plasmids is too low for transformation. Furthermore, the time and/or at which \n\n\fPRACTICAL 2: TRANSFORMATION OF BACTERIAL CELLS \n\n7 \n\nthe bacteria cells are being converted to competent cells and are incorporating the plasmids might \n\nbe wrong for the specific E. coli strain used.  The resultant zero transformations could also possibly \n\nbe  due  to  incorrect  \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc592  and  \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc592  concentrations.  Hence  possible  modifications  to  this \n\nprotocol can be changed as stated by Tang et al., (1994), which used 50\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc40 and 80\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc40 of \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc592 \n\nand \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc592, respectively. Or by Tee  et  al.,  (2017),  which used 20\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc40 and 50\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc40 of \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc592 and \n\n\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc592 ,  respectively. Another  factor  could  be  that  the  plasmid  was  coding  for  resistance  to  a \n\ndifferent antibiotic than ampicillin or that the ampicillin was of such a high concentration that even \n\nthe ampicillin resistant E. coli cells could not survive. \n\nTo conclude, the act of transforming bacterial cells to resist an antibiotic is a simple example of \n\nthe  extremely  useful  biological  tool. This  method  (if  done  successfully)  results  in  a  cheap  and \n\nsimple  way  in  storing  and  replicating  specific  targeted  genes  and  it  is  used  within  biological \n\nindustries. Within  this  practical,  it was shown that  this method, although simple, does result in \n\nmany errors, hence, amendments must be carried out for successful transformations. \n\n \n \n\fPRACTICAL 2: TRANSFORMATION OF BACTERIAL CELLS \n\n8 \n\nReferences: \n\nAsif, A., Mohsin, H., Tanvir, R., & Rehman, Y.

Furthermore,  the \n\nprocess of fermenting milk to yoghurt dates to the earliest known types of fermentations, where \n\nmilk was held in young calve stomachs which contained rennin. Rennin acts as a coagulate to the \n\nsoluble proteins, by converting the proteins to insoluble casein. Currently, the yoghurt is formed \n\nusing a  selectively  bred culture of Lactobacillus and  Streptococcus, which will excrete lactase, \n\nthere by breaking down lactate into  favorable molecules, such as, acetaldehyde. These bacteria \n\nwill also change properties of the milk resulting in the coagulation of the milk\u2019s fat and proteins to \n\nproduce a high viscous texture (Kaur et al., 2017). The yoghurt is sometimes heated so as to kill \n\noff all the added and (possible) foreign microbes, but will not be heated too high, since high enough \n\nheat can result in the yoghurt proteins\u2019 denaturing. As such, a hypothesis within this practical is \n\nthat if the bacteria are detected in the yoghurt sample using gram staining, then it is the selectively \n\nbred  Lactobacillus  and  Streptococcus  which  are  within  the  yoghurt  source  and  are  alive. \n\nFurthermore, within the practical, the observation of fermenting sterile milk into yoghurt shall be \n\nperformed using the starting bacteria culture from a yoghurt source. Hence another hypothesis can \n\nbe made, that being if the bacterial colony is recorded to increase their number in a small period \n\nof time, then the initiation of the conversion of milk to yoghurt has commenced. This method of \n\ncreating yoghurt from pre-existing yoghurt cultures is used within industrial size factories for mass \n\nproduction of yoghurt at a cost-effective way. It should also be noted that within some yoghurt \n\nbrands, the usage of starch instead of milk coagulation is performed to allow for the high viscous \n\n \n\fPRACTICAL 3: FERMENTATION OF YOGHURT \n\n3 \n\ntexture.  As  such,  an  iodine  test  shall  be  performed  to  detect  if  the  yoghurt  contains  starch. \n\nTherefore, a hypothesis shall be stated that if the yoghurt obtained has a high viscous consistency \n\nand has no starch present, then the high viscosity is due to the fermentation process. \n\nProcedure: \n\nThe protocol used within this practical is by Buhagiar. (2021), and can be found in the link below: \n\nhttps://www.um.edu.mt/vle/pluginfile.php/1116168/mod_resource/content/0/Schedule%20Practi\n\ncal%203%20-%20Monitoring%20Growth%20of%20Bacteria%20Yoghurt%20Fermentation%20\n\n-%20Modified.pdf  \n\nModifications: \n\n\u2022 \n\nIn page 1, under procedure, 10 \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc59 of yoghurt culture was added to 150 \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc59 of boiled milk  \n\n\u2022 \n\nIn  page  1,  under  procedure,  only  three  growth  points  were  observed  via  gram  staining. \n\nThese being at 15 \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b, 30\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b and 45 \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b \n\n\u2022  The serial dilution found in page 2 was not performed. \n\n\u2022  The serial dilution used in the spectrophotometer is the following: \n\no  100 \ud835\udf07\ud835\udc59 of 150 \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc59 sterile  milk  mixed  with 10 \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc59 of  fresh  yoghurt  with 900 \ud835\udf07\ud835\udc59 of \n\nphosphate buffer solution. \n\no  10 \ud835\udf07\ud835\udc59  of 150 \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc59  sterile  milk  mixed  with 10 \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc59  of  fresh  yoghurt  with 990 \ud835\udf07\ud835\udc59  of \n\nphosphate buffer solution \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\fPRACTICAL 3: FERMENTATION OF YOGHURT \n\n4 \n\nSources of Errors: \n\n\u2022  Foreign microbes might infiltrate the milk or yoghurt there by ruining the experiment. \n\n\u2022  The bacteria genus present in the yoghurt sample is only assumed to be Lactobacillus and \n\nStreptococcus, due to it being common in finding them in the fermentation of yoghurt. But \n\nit may be another genus of bacteria. \n\n\u2022  The temperature of the milk may go below 42 \u2103 due to human error. \n\nPrecautions: \n\n\u2022  Wear disposable gloves when performing gram staining so as to avoid staining one\u2019s hands. \n\n\u2022  Do not dispose of the gram staining solutions in the sink, but instead in a large beaker for \n\nlater disposal. \n\n\u2022  Use a small drop of yoghurt on the glass slide before heat fixing. \n\n\u2022  When heat fixing does not leave it in the flame too long since it will destroy the bacteria \n\nstructure. \n\n\u2022 \n\nIf debris is found in the thermos clean it with detergent. \n\n\u2022  When boiling the milk do not exceed a temperature of 80 \u2103 to 90 \u2103, so to avoid curdling \n\nof the milk. \n\n\u2022  The temperature of the boiled milk should not reduce past 45 \u2103. \n\n\u2022  Do not put in too much yoghurt into the boiled milk, since if the bacteria concentration is \n\ntoo  high,  a  large  quantity  of  them  will  perform  aerobic  respiration,  which  will  produce \n\nlarge quantities of nasty tasting lactic acid. \n\n\u2022  Mix the yoghurt thoroughly in the milk before the milk\u2019s temperature falls below 45 \u2103. \n\n \n\fPRACTICAL 3: FERMENTATION OF YOGHURT \n\n5 \n\nResults: \n\nTable 1: \n\nSamples \n\nYoghurt \n\nMilk \n\nIodine Test \n\nFehling\u2019s Test \n\nBefore Adding \nSample \nYellow \n\nAfter Adding \nSample \nYellow \n\nBefore Adding \nSample \nBlue \n\nAfter Adding \nSample \nYellow \n\nYellow \n\nYellow \n\nBlue \n\nYellow/Red \n\nNote: This is showing the results of the iodine and Fehling test on the fresh yoghurt and milk \n\nsample to detect the presence of starch and simple sugars. \n\nTable 2: \n\nTime after adding yoghurt sample to sterile \nmile / min \n0 \n15 \n30 \n45 \n\nOptical density \n\n2.755 \n2.653 \n2.801 \n2.724 \n\nNote: This is the optical density taken using the spectrophotometer.

This gab prevented the escape of heat via conduction. \n\nAs seen in Table 1, it was found via the iodine test that there was no change in colour, hence stayed \n\na yellow colour and did  not  turn blue. As such, no starch was present in both the milk  and the \n\nyoghurt. Hence proving the hypothesis that the yoghurt obtained is of a high viscous consistency \n\nvia the fermentation presence alone. It was also found that simple sugars are in fact present in the \n\nmilk and yoghurt since the Fehling\u2019s test when from a blue colour to a yellow to yellow/red colour. \n\nIt is likely that the simple sugar present is lactose. Furthermore, as seen in Figure 1, Figure 2, \n\nFigure 3, Figure 4 and Figure 5, one can observe small purple and pink spherical and rod like cells, \n\nthus, indicating the presence of healthy living bacteria cells. Hence proving the hypothesis that the \n\nyoghurt  does  in  fact  contain  a  healthy  source  of  Lactobacillus  and  Streptococcus  species,  for \n\nfermenting  more  milk  into  yoghurt.  Furthering  this,  since  Lactobacillus  is  a  gram-positive \n\nbacterium, (Kim et al., 2020), then it will stain purple (retains the crystal violate), as such it can be \n\nnoted  that  the  Lactobacillus  can  be  seen  in  Figure  1,  Figure  4  and  Figure  5.  Furthermore, \n\nStreptococcus is a gram-negative bacterium, (Patterson., 1996), thus, it can be seen stained pink in \n\nFigure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, and Figure 5. As such, this further supports the hypothesis that the \n\nyoghurt  bacteria  source  does  in  fact  contain  a  healthy  population  of  Lactobacillus  and \n\nStreptococcus.  Additionally,  observing  Table  3,  it  can  be  seen  that  this  optical  density  value \n\nincreased  by 0.097 \ud835\udc42\ud835\udc37  after 30 \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b ,  as  such,  this  supports  the  hypothesis  that  this  bacterial \n\nculture  is  reproducing,  thereby  consuming  the  milk,  thus,  are  in  fact  fermenting  the  milk  into \n\n\fPRACTICAL 3: FERMENTATION OF YOGHURT \n\n10 \n\nyoghurt. Note, due to Table 2 having too high of an optical density value, it was omitted since it is \n\nout of the accurate detection range. \n\nAs seen in Figure 6, the milk has coagulated into a large gelatin mass. This further supports the \n\nhypothesis that the Lactobacillus and Streptococcus bacteria from the yoghurt source fermented \n\nthe milk into yoghurt. This coagulation is due to the bacteria excreting lactic acid into the milk. \n\nThis  lactic  acid  will  result  in  a  lowering  of  the pH  of  the  milk  thereby  causing  casein  to  form \n\nmicelle,  hence  stated  by, Aryana  &  Olson.  (2017). This  emulsification  of  casein  results  in  the \n\nsoluble casein  to  become insoluble,  thereby resulting  in a high  viscosity, this is  known as acid \n\ncoagulation of milk. \n\nIn conclusion, the absence and presence of starch and simple sugars were found, respectively. The \n\nyoghurt  was  proven  to  be  a  good  source  of  Lactobacillus  and  Streptococcus.  Finally,  the \n\nLactobacillus and Streptococcus were shown to be responsible for the successful coagulation of \n\nmilk to form yoghurt. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fPRACTICAL 3: FERMENTATION OF YOGHURT \n\n11 \n\nReferences: \n\nBuhagiar, \n\nJ. \n\n(2021). \n\nFermentation \n\nof \n\nYoghurt. \n\nhttps://www.um.edu.mt/vle/pluginfile.php/1116168/mod_resource/content/0/Schedule%2\n\n0Practical%203%20-%20Monitoring%20Growth%20of%20Bacteria%20Yogurt%20Fer\n\nmentation%20-%20Modified.pdf  \n\nKaur,  Ramandeep,  Gurpreet  Kaur,  Santosh  Kumar  Mishra,  Harsh  Panwar,  K.
